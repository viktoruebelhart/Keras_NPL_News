# Keras_NPL_News

1 -  ##News Portal. (Keras_NPL_News)

This portal aims to develop an automated solution for classifying news articles into predefined categories. By leveraging machine learning, we intend to streamline the process of sorting vast amounts of news content efficiently and accurately.

The categories for classification are as follows:

-World

-Sports

-Business

-Science and Technology


2 - Word Complete (word_completer_keras)

A new need has emerged: our content portal wants editors and journalists to follow a consistent style when writing texts. 
To do this, we will create a word completer that follows a specific style, similar to the feature found in text editors.
